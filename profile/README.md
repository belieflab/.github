The Belief, Learning, and Memory Lab - directed by Professor Philip R. Corlett, Ph.D. - is an interdisciplinary, translational effort to map mind to brain, to understand cognition, perception, action, and belief. The lab focuses on psychosis, in particular hallucinations (false precepts) and delusions (false beliefs). These departures from consensual reality characterize serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia, but they also exist on a continuum from health to illness. We employ functional neuroimaging, behavioral learning and inference tasks, computational modeling and deep learning to formulate and test explanations of psychosis.
