The Belief Lab - directed by Professor Philip R. Corlett, Ph.D. - is an interdisciplinary, translational effort to map mind to brain, to understand cognition, perception, action, and belief. The lab focuses on psychosis, in particular hallucinations (false precepts) and delusions (false beliefs).

This public repository contains a collection of behavioral tasks that are currently in use and maintained by the lab. They are available free to use. Pull requests are welcome.
