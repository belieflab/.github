The Belief, Learning, and Memory Lab - directed by Professor Philip R. Corlett, Ph.D. - is an interdisciplinary, translational effort to map mind to brain, to understand cognition, perception, action, and belief. The lab focuses on psychosis, in particular hallucinations (false precepts) and delusions (false beliefs).

This collection of behavioral tasks are currently maintained by the lab and are available free to use.
